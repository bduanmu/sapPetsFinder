'''Pets''' are the player's units in Super Auto Pets. Each type of pet has a unique ability, base Health, and base Attack. Pets are bought from the [[Shop]] for 3 {{IconSAP|Gold}} each,  and placed in the player's party. The player's party can only have 5 pets at once. Pets in a player's party can be:
* Repositioned in the party.
* Sold for 1 {{IconSAP|Gold}} per pet Level.
* Merged with other pets of the same type to gain {{IconSAP|Experience}}, and potentially level up.
* Fed [[Food]] to increase their stats or give them [[Food Perks]].

Pet tiers unlock for purchase every other turn until all tiers are unlocked, with tier 1 available on turn 1 to tier 6 opening up on turn 11. The formula is tier X being unlockable in turn (2X-1). All Pets from all previous tiers of the highest tier can still appear.

In battle, your side of Pets attack in order from right to left with the enemy attacking from left to right.

Some pets have abilities that work well with other pets. See [[Pet Archetypes]].

== List of Pets ==
There are a total of 252 pets. 60 of these pets are in the '''{{IconSAP|Turtle Pack|image=Turtle Icon.png}}''', 62 are exclusive to the '''{{IconSAP|Golden Pack}}''', 56 are exclusive to the '''{{IconSAP|Star Pack}}''', 46 are exclusive to the '''{{IconSAP|Puppy Pack}}''' (with 10 more being in the Puppy Pack but still available for free in Custom Packs) and 18 unique pets available only in the'''{{IconSAP|Weekly Pack}}''' or in '''{{IconSAP|Custom Packs}}'''.

All Pets are available for use in Custom Packs as long as you own the the appropriate packs. All Pets except {{IconSAP|Strawberry}} pets and Jerboa are capable of being in the randomly generated Weekly Packs.

[[Tokens]] are not listed here.
